<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a third-year Computer Science at the University of Barcelona. I have a real passion for programming and love to explore new areas such as computer graphics, AI, security, video games, etc.

One of the things I enjoy the most is taking on new challenges and embarking on personal projects. I'm always eager to learn and expand my skills.

Collaboration is also something that I value greatly, and I find it incredibly rewarding to work in a team. It's always amazing to see how different perspectives can lead to creative solutions and produce amazing results.

On my GitHub account, you can find some of my personal projects that I've worked on. I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to apply my programming skills and am open to any ideas or collaborations!
